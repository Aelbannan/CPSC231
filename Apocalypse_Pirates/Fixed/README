This is where the files are going to go for the new Apocalypse verision. Until it works PROPERLY it will be under the BETA
branch. After words we can push it to master. I will change the way the AI works.

The way it will work is 5 modules.

MAIN - Which holds the game loop and Titlescreen

GRID - initializes the pieces, prints the board and checks if knight is valid, and lastly gets the winner.
    - ALSO PENALTY POINTS!

HUMAN - the same as before. Little funcationality with change with this module. Maybe different error checking

AI - AI will get a RANDOM move, from a select few moves. No more random numbers, but rather a random index which refers to
     a list of moves the AI can make. 

MOVE - idc what the name of this one is. Rather this will take the move, from the player, and ai, the previous move, and
       compare how the move will affect the board. It will take pieces away if necessary and will also check if moves are
       valid. This will then push the final board state to the GRID module which will print the board. 
       
       

It shouldn't be too tricky once get the MOVE module created. Just a bunch of changes to be made. I will work on the AI
module and update it when its complete.
