Attached is the part of the Academic Misconduct:

Collaboration and Academic Misconduct
You may discuss these exercises with your team members and instructors of the course. You may not
discuss the exercises with anyone else nor may you use sources other than the textbook and the official
Python website (http://www.python.org) to complete your work for these exercises.
If you are struggling with the exercises and you feel you need additional help, consider one of the
following resources:
• Instructor office hours – Each instructor has office hours twice a week. You can also request an
appointment via e-mail.
• General CT – Graduate students are available in the Computer Science Undergraduate Labs to
answer general questions during continuous tutorials (CT). CTs start in the third week of
classes and a schedule will be posted in the undergraduate labs.
If you wish to use any other sources to help you complete these exercises you must first ask permission
from the instructor.
Any student found copying all or part of an assignment from another student or some other source
(unless this has been explicitly permitted) will be reported to the Dean, who will enforce penalties
which may include failing the course and expulsion from the faculty and university. (See
plagiarism/Cheating/Other Academic Misconduct in the university calendar or the university website
on plagiarism for more information.)
We may use automated procedures that compare electronic documents to detect copied work.
